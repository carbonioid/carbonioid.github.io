            <h3>Hi! I go by carbonioid.</h3>
            <p>This is my cool-looking, horribly maintainable site (css masking just isn't really there yet...)
                <br> <br>
                I made the photos in the banner with my <a target="_black" href="https://github.com/carbonioid/mandelbrot">Mandelbrot explorer</a> and using my amateurish photography skills.
                As as well as programming and photography, I'm also interested in maths, physics, chemistry, linguistics and fractals 
                (hence the <a target="_black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot</a> images.) Also, I listen to a lot of music and play games occasionally.
                <br> <br>
                Currently, I'm very interested in building web apps. You can see the best example of that in my <a target="_black" href="https://github.com/carbonioid/productivity-suite">custom productivity suite</a>. 
                In the past, I've made a lot of esoteric code, simulations (& other cool graphics) and discord bots. 
                I've recently tried to put more of my stuff on GitHub, so you'll probably see all my new work there (if it's public.)
                <br> <br>
                If you'd like to get in touch, I'm best reached via Discord if you know me <i>in the real life</i>, or email if you don't.
