Also, the focus going in and out from different flowerheads gives it such a fluid feel without needing to blur the photo to indicate wind, whicih really emphasises the impact of being directly above the sea.",

But it was surprisingly difficult: the generic shot of the roofing, parallel to the proper direction, didn't really work because my camera couldn't capture the parallax properly, so there was no sense of scale. I tried some other photos from the ground upwards (low angle shots) but none of then looked very good because the roof of Paddington isn't very interesting without context. Eventually, I found a spot without many people and managed to snatch this shot of the roof and crop it down to get rid of any noise. I am *very* pleased that I at least got something because Paddington station is a very beautiful thing in person.",

But the blur does give a nice sense of movement which you often lose in aquariums and photography. So I guess I'm righting two wrongs.",

Only one wall still exists, and there are no buildings anywhere near it. Plus, it's at the top of a cliff. Who builds something there? I think I managed to frame the oddness of it pretty well here, but it still looks a bit more normal than I consider it because I can't give the context of the whole surroundings (and the lack of building) in a photo. Potentially, I could've tried to frame the edge of the cliff to give it a sense of precariousness.",
